What's the only thing better than Polaroid pictures? Gif polaroids!

## Getting Started

Enter a new search term to create a new Polaroid gif, generated by calling the <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">GIPHY API</a>.

Click your newly created button (or pick from a pre-selected set) to load a series of 10 random gifs on that topic. Click each gif to toggle on or off the animation.

Each of your search terms are saved in local storage, so when you visit the page again your polaroids will pre-load, ready to be viewed again. 

Built to practice API calls, accessing JSON data, and data persistance in local storage.
